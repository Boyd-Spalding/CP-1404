# What did you see in line 1?
#   A random integer between 5 and 20 (inclusive)
#   Smallest number I could have seen was 5 and the biggest number was 20

# What did you see in line 2?
#   A number between 3 and 10, that is in a step of 2 from the starting number 3. I.e. 3, 5, 7, 9
#   The smallest number produced could have been 3 and the largest could have been 9
#   This line could have not produced a 4

# What did you see in line 3?
#   I saw several random floating numbers between 2.5 and 5.5
#   The smallest number is 2.5 and th largest is 5.5 I think
